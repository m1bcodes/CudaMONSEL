\chapter{Conclusion}
Overall, a working prototype of a spatial channel sounding device consisting of USRPs, mini-computers, GPS receivers, and atomic clocks was constructed. It used bi-static SAR algorithms to reconstruct the locations of scatterers in a field test. It has a spatial resolution of 12 m, and costs much less than current channel sounding solutions (around \$12000 in total, see Table \ref{tab:total_cost}, versus the \$100,000+ devices currently used). It is not without operational issues and difficulties however, so future work should continue on this project to make it commercially viable.
%In our first milestone, we have assembled a working setup consisting of a transmitter and a receiver from USRPs, GPSDOs, Mini-PCs and UPS. For our second milestone, we successfully identified a scatterer (Kaiser wall) using by transmitting a known signal and examine the time delay of the signal peak with respect to the line of sight peak. In our third milestone, we collected enough data during our field campaign and successfully reconstructed a scene on 16th ave. Overall, the project is a success.
