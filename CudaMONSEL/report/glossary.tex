\bfseries{ADC} & Analog to Digital Converter\\
\bfseries{Back Projection} & A time-domain algorithm takes advantage of the changing Doppler shift over time to map out relative locations of scatterers\\
\bfseries{Channel} & In telecommunications, the physical medium used to transmit a signal\\
\bfseries{Channel Model} & A description of a physical channel, including scatterers, distortion effects, and fading\\
\bfseries{DAC} & Digital to Analog Converter\\
\bfseries{DRGPS} & Dead Reckoning GPS, a device that combines GPS information and vehicle speed information to gauge position accurately\\
\bfseries{Fading} & When 2 signals of different phase interfere, causing destructive interference\\
%\bfseries{FSPL} & Free Space Path Loss, the attenuation of a radio signal as it travels from an isotropic radiator to an isotropic antenna via free space. The attenuation encapsulates the effect of propagation distance and the effect of the antenna \\
%\bfseries{GPGGA} & Global Positioning System Fix Data\\
\bfseries{GPS} & Global Positioning System, a network of satellites used for reckoning positioning and time. \\
\bfseries{GPSDO} & GPS Disciplined Oscillator, a highly precise (and accurate) clock. \\
\bfseries{HSR} & High speed rail \\
\bfseries{MIMO} & Multiple input multiple output, a radio technique involving sending data along different paths than the main line of sight in order to increase capacity or to work around obstructions\\
\bfseries{PPS} & Pulse-per-second signal, shared by GPSDOs acquired from the GPS system\\
\bfseries{PRBS} & Pseudo-Random Binary Sequence. A binary sequence of numbers consisting strictly of 0 and 1\\
\bfseries{Processing Frame} & A linear array that contains a pre-defined number of samples meant to be processed as a single unit.\\
\bfseries{SAR} & Synthetic aperture radar, an imaging technique that uses moving antennas to construct a scene\\
\bfseries{Scatterer} & An object that deflects a radio signal, causing multiple propagation paths\\
\bfseries{UPS} & Uninterrupted Power Supply\\
\bfseries{USRP} & Universal Software Radio Peripheral, a device with fast DACs and ADCs for radio signals\\
