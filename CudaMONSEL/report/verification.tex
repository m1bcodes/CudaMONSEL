\chapter{System Verification}\label{sec:Verification}\label{sec:verify}
A variety of tests were implemented to ensure the correctness of both data imported and computation.
\begin{enumerate}
   \item Bench tests aiming to identify effects brought about by the channel sounder hardware.
   \item Stationary ranging tests aiming to verify the channel sounder's ranging capability. 
   \item Road test aiming to verify the DRGPS' position accuracy over the upcoming test campaign's terrain.
\end{enumerate}
