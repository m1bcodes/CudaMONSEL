There are several stages before the simulation starts to ensure the correctness of both data imported and computation. First, $testLibrary$ function runs library tests to ensure that container classes in Amphibian library runs error--free. $initSim$ loads the data required for simulation. $testSim$ runs the tests implemented for any JMONSEL tests included in the $testSim$ function. Some of these tests require the data loaded from the previous step. $loadNUTable$ loads the scattering tables required for TabulatedInelasticSM class.
