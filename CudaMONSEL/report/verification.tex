\chapter{System Verification}\label{sec:verify}
The program uses a series of smoke tests to ensure that most systems are functioning properly. Smoke tests include tests for library, imported data and computed results. Test sets obey the topological order (ie proper functionality of one test set relies on that of the previous test set). Similarly, tests within each test set obeys the topological order.

First, \textit{testLibrary} function runs library tests to ensure that container classes in Amphibian library work as they should. \textit{initSim} loads the data required (eg caches and tables, excluding scattering tables) for simulation. \textit{testSim} runs the tests implemented for JMONSEL classes included in the original JMONSEL code. Some of these tests require the data loaded from the previous step, \textit{initSim}. \textit{loadNUTable} loads the scattering tables required for TabulatedInelasticSM class. Finally, \textit{initRange} defines the locations of the raster scan and therefore the resolution of the final image.
